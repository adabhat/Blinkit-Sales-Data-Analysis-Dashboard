## ✅ Key Insights:
1️⃣ **High-size outlets**, though the fewest in number, bring in the highest average sales.  
Medium-sized outlets, despite being the most common, generate the lowest average sales.  

2️⃣ **Tier-2 cities**, although having fewer stores, have the highest average sales across all city tiers.  

3️⃣ A **shift in demand for items with fat content** — declining in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities but steady or rising in Tier-3 — could reflect growing fitness or vegan lifestyle trends reaching Tier-1/2 before Tier-3.  

4️⃣ A **spike in sales in 2018** was mainly due to a Tier-3 Medium Supermarket 3 store ($130K in sales).

## 💡Business Recommendations:
1) **Re-assess outlet allocation** — expand High-Size outlets in Tier-2 cities (high sales despite fewer locations).  
2) **Re-evaluate Medium-Size outlets**, especially in Tier-1 and Tier-2 where they’re most common but least efficient.  
3) **Tailor product offerings by fat content** based on regional health trends.  
4) **Investigate anomalies** like the 2018 Tier-3 spike to replicate success.
